# Catflap Camera

The Catflap Camera is a simple Python script which uses a Raspberry Pi and the add-on Raspberry Pi camera board and a reed switch trigger to take a picture when a catflap is used, thus capturing a lovely picture of whichever cat was using the catflap at the time.

The camera was used in the production of BBC Two's "Cat Watch 2014: The New Horizon Experiment". This repository is an open source version of the camera software, with instructions on how to build your own.
